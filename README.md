# Ubuntu Bootstrap

This is a personal repository, nothing to see here.

## If you are me...

Run this on any new ubuntu machine to set it up just as you like it:

```bash
curl -Ls get.dannyb.co/bootstrap | bash
```

It is recommended to run this on a fully updated machine - update using:

```bash
apt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt autoremove -y
reboot # if needed
```
